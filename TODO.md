## Idea
- P2P lending service to keep interest rates down
- Lenders invest in a large global pool, specifying the amount they're giving, how much they expect back, and the risk factor they're okay with
- Loaners are categorized by risk based on their borrowing history
- Loaners have to take out a loan in groups, which they create at the time of borrowing
    + Based on their history, they get categorized into risk groups
    + Compare to how much it would cost if you did it via credit cards or payday loans

## Architecture
- Deployment process for Bluemix
- Possibly make use of [Visa Developer APIs](https://developer.visa.com/)
